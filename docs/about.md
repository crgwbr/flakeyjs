## About

Flakey.js was written by [Craig Weber](http://crgwbr.com) in his spare time, fueled mainly by coffee. Flakey.js was largely inspired by the fantastic [Spine.js](http://spinejs.com/) framework, which is great for apps that don't work well with Flakey's built in model versioning, or that require a more relational model structure.
